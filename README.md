#I'll be slowly filling out this repo with my solutions to the top code wars questions. 
#The solutions will be in OCaml so I can learn it!

you can run any program by going into the folder and typing:
dune exec -- ./hello_world.exe where hello_world.exe is program_name.exe

if you get any Command 'dune' not found or similar errors you can try installing:
sudo apt install ocaml-dune

and then try running:
eval $(opam env)

new project will be:
dune init proj project_name
